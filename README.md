## About Me
My name is Lin yu-chu.  
This repository documents my learning journey in Python programming and software development.

## What I Learned About Clean Code
Throughout this subject, I learned to:
- Write code that is easy to read, using meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Follow proper formatting and style conventions (PEP 8) to improve clarity.
- Break large problems into smaller, reusable components using functions and classes.
- Write documentation and comments that help others understand my code.
