# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. 
I often underestimated the time needed, especially for tasks involving new concepts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the weeks progressed, my estimates became more realistic. 
I learned to factor in debugging time, reading documentation, and unexpected issues.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned how to break tasks into smaller parts and plan more effectively.
Estimating helped me understand my workflow and improve my time-management skills.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned how others approach problems differently 
and how small improvements—such as clearer variable names 
or better structure—can make my code easier to read and maintain.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code trained me to identify issues more quickly and recognise common patterns. 
It also helped me realise what good code structure looks like and apply those ideas to my own work.
Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs 
that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac_06](https://github.com/HuangZhaozhang/cp1404prac/pull/2)

### Explanation

Because I think is good, so I comment it good for affirm its code.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac_06](https://github.com/HuangZhaozhang/cp1404prac/pull/2)

### Explanation

Because I receive pull request for one times, so I cannot give the second one.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more small examples and hints at the start of each practical, especially for beginners,
to help them quickly understand the key idea before starting the larger tasks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently completed tasks on time, improved my coding style each week,
and actively used feedback from reviews to improve the quality and structure of my code.
