# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started planning my programs more carefully before coding,
including writing pseudocode and testing incrementally. 
This helps me understand the logic better and reduce debugging time.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to manage my time more effectively and avoid rushing to complete practicals at the last minute. 
I also need to review past exercises regularly to strengthen my understanding.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistent in submitting my work and asking questions when I do not understand something. 
I also make sure to test my code thoroughly and follow good coding conventions.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should stop depending too much on example code and try to solve problems independently first. 
This will help me build stronger programming logic and confidence.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest having more hands-on coding challenges or mini-projects 
that connect practical skills to real-world applications. 
This would make the subject more engaging and realistic for future IT work.
